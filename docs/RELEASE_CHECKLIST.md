# Release Checklist (Local-First)

This project uses a shared Dev/Preview database. Treat it as a shared environment: avoid destructive changes, announce migrations, and coordinate with the team before applying them.

## 1) Local Changes

- Update code as needed.
- If schema changes are required:
  - Run `pnpm db:generate` to create a migration.
  - Apply locally: `pnpm db:migrate`.

## 2) Local Validation

- Start apps locally with `pnpm dev`.
- Run smoke tests for critical flows.
- If storage changes are involved, validate buckets/policies manually.

## 3) Commit

- Ensure `git status` is clean except intended changes.
- Commit with a clear message.

## 4) Promote to Preview (preview)

- Push to `preview`.
- Confirm CI passes.
- Verify preview endpoints (health + key pages).

## 5) Promote to Prod (main)

- Merge `preview` into `main`.
- Confirm CI passes.
- Smoke test production (health + key endpoints).
